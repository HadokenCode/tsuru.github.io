*This is a guest post by [Colin Saliceti](https://github.com/saliceti).*

[Tsuru, the enterprise-grade PaaS with Brazilian roots](http://www.slideshare.net/saliceti/tsuru-london-paas-user-group)

>Tsuru was born and is actively developed at globo.com, the web arm of Globo, the Brazilian media giant. It is now gaining traction across the world and already has many international contributors.

>You may think of Tsuru as "yet-another-Docker-based-PaaS", but it is was actually started before Docker based PaaS were cool. Its great maturity brings unique features: it is fast, secure, flexible, pluggable, multi tenants, deploys with zero downtime, auto scales apps, auto scales IaaSâ€¦

Thanks to the audience for the great interest, thanks to LoPUG for the organisation (and the beers).
