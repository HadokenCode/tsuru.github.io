Good news: we are going to present a poster about tsuru at [CloudStack Collaboration Conference Europe](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/cloudstack-collaboration-conference-europe)!

The goal of the presentation is to introduce tsuru and its components, demonstrating how they work together and diving as deep as possible into their architectures.

The audience will have the opportunity to better know what's behind tsuru, for example:

* how the architecture looks like
* how the production environment looks like with Docker
* how to run tsuru in your own infrastructure
* how to provide and use services in tsuru applications
* the integration between tsuru and Apache CloudStack

See you in Budapest!
