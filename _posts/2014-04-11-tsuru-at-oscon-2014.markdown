<p>Good news: we are going to talk about tsuru at <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014" title="OSCON 2014">OSCON 2014</a>! The talk, entitled <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/34093" title="Tsuru: Open Source Cloud Application Platform">"Tsuru: Open Source Cloud Application Platform"</a>, will cover the history, evolution and architecture of tsuru, including its context and  adoption at <a href="http://globo.com" title="Globo.com">Globo.com</a>.<br />
<a href="http://blog.tsuru.io/2014/04/04/running-tsuru-in-production-scaling-and-segregating-docker-containers/" title="Running tsuru in production: scaling and segregating Docker containers"></a></p>
<p>The goal of the presentation is to introduce tsuru and its components, demonstrating how they work together and diving as deep as possible into their architectures.</p>
<p>The audience will have the opportunity to better know what's behind tsuru, for example:<a id="more"></a><a id="more-57"></a></p>
<ol>
<li>how we use the <a href="http://golang.org" title="Go">Go</a> programming language to build tsuru</li>
<li>how to provide and use <a href="http://docs.tsuru.io/en/stable/apps/client/services.html">services</a> in tsuru applications</li>
<li>how the architecture looks like</li>
<li>how the production environment looks like with <a href="http://juju.ubuntu.com" title="Juju">Juju</a> and <a href="http://docker.io" title="Docker">Docker</a></li>
<li>how to run tsuru in your own infrastructure</li>
</ol>
<p>We will cover each of these topics in future posts in this blog (there's already a post about <a href="http://blog.tsuru.io/2014/04/04/running-tsuru-in-production-scaling-and-segregating-docker-containers/" title="Running tsuru in production: scaling and segregating Docker containers">Docker in production</a>).</p>
<p>See you at OSCON 2014!</p>
